**Section 2.2 Complete: Feature Matching Module**

Successfully implemented the LightGlue-based feature matching system with the following components:

### Core Implementation (`main/core/feature_matching.py`):
- **FeatureMatcher class** with extensible factory pattern architecture
- **LightGlue integration** as the primary matcher (ready for future SuperGlue, LoFTR additions)
- **GPU-accelerated inference** with proper tensor handling and device management
- **Comprehensive matching pipeline**:
  - `match_pairs()` - Pairwise feature matching between two images
  - `match_all_pairs()` - Efficient all-pairs matching with progress tracking
  - `filter_matches()` - Geometric verification (fundamental matrix, homography)
  - `visualize_matches()` - Match visualization with confidence-based coloring

### Key Features:
- **Clean architecture separation**: Feature extraction â†’ Feature matching (as planned)
- **Confidence-based filtering**: Configurable match thresholds and max match limits
- **Geometric verification**: RANSAC-based fundamental matrix and homography filtering
- **Robust error handling**: Graceful failure handling for challenging image pairs
- **Memory optimization**: Efficient GPU memory usage for batch processing
- **Rich visualization**: Side-by-side match visualization with confidence coloring

### Testing Infrastructure (`scripts/test_feature_matching.py`):
- **Comprehensive test suite** covering all major functionality
- **Integration testing** with existing SuperPoint feature extractor
- **Performance benchmarking** with detailed logging and statistics
- **Visual validation** with automatic match visualization generation
- **Geometric filtering validation** with inlier ratio reporting

### Configuration Updates:
- Updated `base_config.yaml` to use LightGlue as default matcher
- Maintained compatibility with existing feature extraction configuration
- Ready for future matcher type extensions

### Architecture Benefits:
- **Future-proof design**: Easy to add new matcher types (SuperGlue, LoFTR, etc.)
- **Modular separation**: Clean interface between feature extraction and matching
- **Production-ready**: Robust error handling, logging, and performance optimization
- **Research-friendly**: Easy experimentation with different matching parameters

### Implementation Notes:
- **Switched from SuperGlue to LightGlue**: SuperGlue is not available in the LightGlue package, but LightGlue provides state-of-the-art matching performance with SuperPoint features
- **Seamless integration**: LightGlue uses the same API structure as SuperGlue, making the implementation clean and consistent
- **Optimal pairing**: SuperPoint (feature extraction) + LightGlue (matching) is the recommended combination from the LightGlue authors

The implementation successfully bridges SuperPoint feature extraction with LightGlue matching, providing a solid foundation for the upcoming pose estimation phase (Section 3.1). The system is now ready to handle robust feature matching across image pairs with state-of-the-art deep learning methods.
